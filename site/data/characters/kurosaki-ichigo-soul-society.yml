name: Kurosaki Ichigo
version: Soul Society
origin: Bleach
roles:
  - role-striker
  - role-skirmisher
difficulty: Medium
gameplan: >
  Win fights the way Ichigo does here: clean sword pressure, Shunpo to steal
  tempo, build Reiatsu through exchanges, then cash out with Getsuga. Bankai is
  your end-it speed window, and Hollow Interference is a single risky surge that
  can save or throw the fight.
