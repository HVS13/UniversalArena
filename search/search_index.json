Keep answers short and link to deeper pages when needed.</p> How do I win a match? <p>Reduce all opposing characters' HP to 0 (or meet the scenario's win condition, if you're playing a special mode).</p> How does Ultimate Meter work? <p>Your team gains Ultimate Meter as you play cards; it is a shared resource. Once you have enough, any character can pay the Ultimate Meter cost to use its Ultimate card. Ultimate cards sit outside the draw pile and are always available to play.</p> Can I bring two of the same character? <p>Not if they have the same Name and Version on the same team.</p> Do card or character effects override the core rules? <p>Yes. If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, apply that effect as written.</p> When a card says it becomes another card, is it optional or timing-limited? <p>It is automatic, not optional. Treat the card as the new card in any zone (deck, hand, play) whenever the condition is true.</p> <p></p> How do On Gain and delayed status triggers work? <p>On Gain resolves immediately when the status is gained, even if it is not Turn Start. If an effect says \"When this expires: At your next Turn Start, ...\", it queues a delayed trigger that still resolves at that next Turn Start even after the status is gone. Example: If you gain Gear 3rd during your turn, you immediately gain 3 Strength and 1 Slow. Gear 3rd expires at Turn End, but its expiration still schedules Deflate at your next Turn Start.</p> What are Basic, Technique, Ultimate, and Created cards? <p>Basic cards are the two core cards in a character's starting five. Technique cards are the three non-basic cards in that starting five. Ultimate cards start outside the draw pile and cost Ultimate Meter. Created cards are generated by effects and follow normal card rules unless the effect says otherwise.</p> What is a Combat Round and the Active Zone? <p>A Combat Round starts when the initiative player plays a card. The zone they choose becomes the Active Zone. Players can only add cards to the Active Zone (or a faster zone) until both pass, then the Active Zone resolves right to left.</p> Where can I play a card based on Speed? <p>Fast cards can be played in any zone, Normal cards in the Normal or Slow Zone, and Slow cards only in the Slow Zone. A faster zone can interrupt a slower Active Zone.</p> <p></p> How does Evade work against Shield in an Attack vs Defense clash? <p>In an Attack vs Defense clash, resolve Defense first to gain Shield, then resolve the Attack. Evade checks after Shield: if the Attack would deal 0 Power damage after Shield, it is not a hit and you Reuse the Defense card. If any Power damage gets through Shield, the Attack is a hit and Evade does not apply. Example: Defense rolls 10 Shield and the Attack rolls 10 or less, Evade triggers; if the Attack rolls 11+, Evade does not.</p> How do multiple damage types interact with Resist, Weakness, and Absorb? <p>A card counts as all listed damage types and attack tags. If a modifier lists multiple types or tags, it applies once when any match; separate modifiers stack. For flat/percentage formats, calculate both and use the higher value, then apply after Shield. If any matching Immune applies, damage becomes 0. Example: A Magical + Blunt attack deals 20 damage after Shield. The target has Resist 5 (Blunt) and Absorb 30% (Magical). Resist reduces 5, Absorb reduces 6 and heals 6. Final damage is 9.</p> How do Created cards enter play? <p>The effect that creates the card tells you where it goes (hand, draw pile, discard pile, or play). If it does not specify, add it to the discard pile.</p> Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again? <p>Yes. Reapplying a status effect increases its values according to its mode, up to its cap. For Potency + Count effects, see the next question.</p> Is Spend optional? <p>No. \"Spend X\" is mandatory; if you cannot spend the full amount, that part of the effect does not happen. If a Spend is optional, the effect must say \"may.\"</p> If a status effect has potency and count, and an effect says \\\"Inflict X A\\\", what happens to the count? <p>If the target already has A, only potency increases by X; count stays the same. If the target has no A, it gains A with potency X and count 1. The same rule applies to Gain on allies.</p> What does \\\"Halve\\\" mean? <p>\"Halve\" means set the current value to half of its current value, rounding down (floor).

Generally, Potency determines strength, while Count determines duration.</li> </ul> <p>Trigger labels like \"Turn Start,\" \"Turn End,\" \"On Gain,\" and \"Allies' Card Played\" describe when the effect happens. \"On Gain\" triggers immediately when the status is gained, even during Combat. \"Allies' Card Played\" triggers whenever any ally (including the user) plays a card.</p> <p>\"Next Turn Start\" means the next time that unit reaches Turn Start, even if the status that created the trigger has expired. If an effect says \"When this expires: At your next Turn Start, ...\", it creates a delayed trigger that resolves at that next Turn Start.</p> <p>In single-value or double-value modes, if one or more values reach 0, the status effect is removed from the unit. When multiple effects at the same timing point would consume and gain status values, apply all reductions or consumptions first, then apply gains or inflictions. If a single effect specifies its own order (example: \"Take damage, then reduce Count\"), follow that text.</p> <p>Status effects also come with a few attributes:</p> <ul> <li>Base Value: the initial value on infliction if none is specified.</li> <li>Max Value: the maximum value (default 99).</li> </ul> <p>Status effects also have a type: Positive, Negative, or Unique. Unique status effects are character-specific and are documented on the character page only, not in this reference.</p> <p>Reapplying a status effect increases its Potency, Count, Stack, or Value up to its cap, following any mode-specific rules below.</p> <p>For Potency + Count effects, \"Inflict/Gain X\" increases Potency by X; if the target has none, set Potency to X and Count to 1.</p> <p>\"Halve\" means set the current value to half its current value, rounding down.</p> Timing order <p>When multiple status effects trigger at the same timing point (Turn Start, Turn End, etc.):</p> <ul> <li>Follow any explicit \"then\" order written on the effect itself.</li> <li>If there is no explicit order between effects, apply them in any order, but apply all reductions or consumptions before any gains or inflictions to the same status effect.</li> <li>After all effects apply, remove any status effect whose value reaches 0.</li> <li>If a specific effect contradicts this order, apply it as written.</li> </ul> Power modifiers <p>Strength and Weakened modify Attack Power. Dexterity and Frail modify Defense Power.</p> <p>When both a positive and negative modifier apply, use net Potency (positive - negative). Multiply the card's Power min and max by (1 + 0.10 x net Potency), then round down. Power has no minimum clamp.</p> Speed shift <p>Speed modifiers use a step-shift system. Each Potency shifts Speed by 1 step. Haste and Slow cancel step-for-step (example: Haste 2 and Slow 1 results in a net +1 step). Net shift is capped at 2 steps total.

By default, at Turn Start each player sets Energy to 5; effects can modify this and there is no Energy cap. Ultimate Meter The shared team resource that powers the strongest abilities; any character can spend it. Your team gains Ultimate Meter when you play cards. Design target: in a standard 3v3 match, a normal team gains about 5 Ultimate Meter per turn on average; some characters gain faster or slower. Spend When an effect says to Spend X (Energy, Ammo, a status value, etc.), you must reduce that resource by X to resolve that part of the effect. If you cannot spend the full amount, that part of the effect does not happen. Optional Spend must say \"may.\" Ultimate Card A card that starts outside the draw pile and is always available to play. It follows normal card rules and counts as an Ultimate type for effects. Ammo A per-weapon resource tracked separately for each weapon (example: Handgun Ammo, Shotgun Ammo). Cards may require or spend Ammo; if you cannot spend the required amount, that effect does not activate. \"Full\" means the amount granted by the effect or innate that set the Ammo. Switching weapons does not change each weapon's stored Ammo unless stated. Reload Lose all current Ammo for the currently equipped weapon, then set that weapon's Ammo to its full value as defined by its source. Turn Structure Initiative Determines who takes the first action at Combat Start each turn. Rules Rule Priority If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, apply the effect as written. On Gain A status effect timing label that resolves immediately when the status is gained, even mid-turn. See FAQ. Card Flow Discard The act of moving a card from your hand to the Discard Pile. Unplayed cards are typically discarded at the end of each turn. Some card effects also cause you to discard cards during your turn. Draw The act of taking cards from your Draw Pile and adding them to your hand. By default, at Turn Start you draw until you reach a hand size of 5, modified by draw effects (if any). Played A card is played when it is placed in a legal zone after paying its cost and selecting legal targets. Used A card is used when its effects apply. Unless a timing is explicitly stated, a card's text is On Use. Becomes If a card becomes another card due to a condition, treat it as that other card in any zone (deck, hand, play) as long as the condition is true. This replacement is automatic, not optional. Cancelled A cancelled card skips its effects from Before Use onward (Before Use, On Use, On Hit, After Use). Always still applies. Negated A negated card skips all effects, including Always. Card Categories Basic Card A card tagged Basic. Each character has two Basic cards in their starting five. Technique Card A non-basic, non-ultimate card from a character's kit. Each character has three Technique cards in their starting five. Created Card A card generated by an effect that did not start in a character's initial five cards. If the effect does not specify where it goes, add it to the discard pile. Characters Role A character archetype tag used to communicate playstyle. See Roles. Combat Combat Round A sequence that begins when the initiative player plays a card and ends when all zones are empty. Active Zone The current zone being played in; cards in it are used during a Combat Round. Priority The right to act next during Combat. Priority passes after each play or pass. Hit An Attack that is used is a hit unless a rule or effect prevents it (example: Evade). See FAQ for an Evade timing example. Damage Types &amp; Attack Tags Cards can list multiple Damage Types (Physical, Magical, Mental, Electric) and Attack Tags (Slash, Pierce, Blunt, Multihit). A card counts as all listed types and tags for matching. If a single modifier lists multiple types or tags, it applies once when any match; separate modifiers stack. Power The min-max value shown on a card. It is usually +/- floor(Base Power x 0.20) for Melee and +/- floor(Base Power x 0.25) for Ranged. Power Roll The rolled value from a card's Power used for clash comparisons, damage dealt, Shield gained, and HP recovered. Roll Power each time a card is used. Reuse If a card is instructed to Reuse, do not discard it after its clash; keep it in the current zone so it can be paired again during the same zone resolution. Defense Shield Temporary protection that soaks damage before HP. At Turn End, remove all Shield. Targeting Ally A character on the same team, including self unless an effect says another ally. Allies All characters on the same team, including self. Enemy A character on the opposite team. Enemies All characters on the opposite team. Self The character that uses the card. Adjacent Characters are arranged left to right in a single row. Adjacent means the immediate left or right neighbor of the target. Area AoE Area of Effect. All characters in the targeted area take the effect. Bounce A random adjacent character to the main target will also take the effect. Splash An adjacent character to the main target will also take the effect. Math Halve Set the current value to half its current value, rounding down (floor). Rounding Any time a calculation results in a decimal, round down (floor)."},{"location":"characters/","title":"Characters","text":"<p>Pick a character to view their cards.
