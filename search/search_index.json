If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, resolve that effect as written.</p> Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again? <p>Yes.

Generally, Potency determines strength, while Count determines duration.</li> </ul> <p>In single-value or double-value modes, if one or more of the values reach 0, the status effect is removed from the unit.

By default, at Turn Start each player sets energy to 5; effects can modify this and there is no energy cap. Ultimate Meter The shared team resource that powers the strongest abilities. Design target: in a standard 3v3 match, a normal team gains about 5 Ultimate Meter per turn on average; some characters gain faster or slower. Ultimate Card A card that starts outside the draw pile and is always available to play. It follows normal card rules and counts as Ultimate type for effects. Turn Structure Initiative Determines who takes the first action at Combat Start each turn. Card Flow Discard The act of moving a card from your hand to the Discard Pile. Unplayed cards are typically discarded at the end of each turn. Some card effects also cause you to discard cards during your turn. Draw The act of taking cards from your Draw Pile and adding them to your hand. By default, at Turn Start you draw until you reach a hand size of 5, modified by draw effects (if any). Combat Hit An Attack that resolves is a hit unless a rule or effect prevents it (example: Evade). Power The min-max value shown on a card. It is derived from designer-only Base Power using +/- floor(Base Power x 0.20). Power Roll The rolled value from a card's Power used for clash comparisons and for damage dealt, shield gained, and HP recovered. Roll Power each time a card resolves. Reuse If a card is instructed to Reuse, do not discard it after its clash; keep it in the current zone so it can be paired again during the same resolution. Defense Shield Temporary protection that soaks damage before HP. At Turn End, remove all shield. Targeting Ally A character on the same team. Allies All characters on the same team. Enemy A character on the opposite team. Enemies All characters on the opposite team. Self The character that uses the card. Adjacent Characters are arranged left to right in a single row. Adjacent means the immediate left or right neighbor of the target. Area AoE Area of Effect. All characters will take the effect. Bounce A random adjacent character to the main target will also take the effect. Splash An adjacent character to the main target will also take the effect."},{"location":"characters/","title":"Characters","text":"<p>Pick a character to view their cards.
