version: Resident Evil 4
origin: Resident Evil
roles:
  - role-striker
  - role-artillery
difficulty: Medium
gameplan: >
  Choose the right weapon with Switch Weapon, use Handgun for steady multihit
  poke and Riot Gun for follow-up burst into Suplex stuns, then dump excess
  Energy into Chicago Typewriter. Defend reloads your current weapon and keeps
  you safe; save Rocket Launcher for swing turns, and buy it with meter if you
  need the finisher.
