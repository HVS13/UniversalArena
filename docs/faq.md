??? question "How do I win a match?"
    Reduce all opposing characters' HP to 0 (or meet the scenario's win condition, if you're playing a special mode).

??? question "How does Ultimate Meter work?"
    Your team gains Ultimate Meter as you play cards; it is a shared resource. Once you have enough, any character can pay the Ultimate Meter cost to use its Ultimate card. Ultimate cards sit outside the draw pile and are always available to play.

??? question "Can I bring two of the same character?"
    Not if they have the same Name and Version on the same team.

??? question "Do card or character effects override the core rules?"
    Yes. If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, apply that effect as written.

??? question "When a card says it becomes another card, is it optional or timing-limited?"
    It is automatic, not optional. Treat the card as the new card in any zone (deck, hand, play) whenever the condition is true.

??? question "How do On Gain and delayed status triggers work?"
    <a class="ua-term-link" data-term="term-on-gain" href="#">On Gain</a> resolves immediately when the status is gained, even if it is not Turn Start. If an effect says "When this expires: At your next Turn Start, ...", it queues a delayed trigger that still resolves at that next Turn Start even after the status is gone.
    Example: If you gain Gear 3rd during your turn, you immediately gain 3 <a class="ua-status-link" data-status="status-strength" href="#">Strength</a> and 1 <a class="ua-status-link" data-status="status-slow" href="#">Slow</a>. Gear 3rd expires at Turn End, but its expiration still schedules Deflate at your next Turn Start.

??? question "What are Basic, Technique, Ultimate, and Created cards?"
    Basic cards are the two core cards in a character's starting five. Technique cards are the three non-basic cards in that starting five. Ultimate cards start outside the draw pile and cost Ultimate Meter. Created cards are generated by effects and follow normal card rules unless the effect says otherwise.

??? question "What is a Combat Round and the Active Zone?"
    A Combat Round starts when the initiative player plays a card. The zone they choose becomes the Active Zone. Players can only add cards to the Active Zone (or a faster zone) until both pass, then the Active Zone resolves right to left.

<a id="faq-movement-round"></a>
??? question "How does the Movement Round work?"
    During the <a class="ua-term-link" data-term="term-movement-round" href="#">Movement Round</a>, players alternate priority. On your priority, you may spend 1 Energy to swap two adjacent allies or Pass. Movement swaps are not card plays and do not grant Ultimate Meter. If a swap would include a rooted character, the swap fails but the Energy is still spent. The round ends when both players pass consecutively. Rooted characters cannot be moved or swapped.

<a id="faq-healing-reduction"></a>
??? question "How do Wound and Wither reduce healing?"
    Determine the healing amount, then reduce it by <a class="ua-status-link" data-status="status-wither" href="#">Wither</a> (percent) and <a class="ua-status-link" data-status="status-wound" href="#">Wound</a> (flat) before applying it. If both apply, reduce by both, then clamp the healing to a minimum of 0.
    Example: You would heal 12 HP with Wither 10 and Wound 3. Wither reduces the heal by 1 (10% of 12), Wound reduces it by 3, so you heal 8 total.

??? question "Where can I play a card based on Speed?"
    Fast cards can be played in any zone, Normal cards in the Normal or Slow Zone, and Slow cards only in the Slow Zone. A faster zone can interrupt a slower Active Zone.

<a id="faq-cannot-play-cards"></a>
??? question "What happens when a player cannot play cards?"
    While an effect says a player cannot play cards, they cannot add cards to any zone; they still pass priority and resolve cards already played. Example: If a Time Stop effect is used mid-round, the opponent can only pass until the round ends, and all already played cards still resolve.

<a id="faq-evade-shield"></a>
??? question "How does Evade work against Shield in an Attack vs Defense clash?"
    In an Attack vs Defense clash, resolve Defense first to gain <a class="ua-term-link" data-term="term-shield" href="#">Shield</a>, then resolve the Attack. <a class="ua-keyword-link" data-keyword="keyword-evade" href="#">Evade</a> checks after Shield: if the Attack would deal 0 Power damage after Shield, it is not a hit and you <a class="ua-keyword-link" data-keyword="keyword-reuse" href="#">Reuse</a> the Defense card. If any Power damage gets through Shield, the Attack is a hit and Evade does not apply. Example: Defense rolls 10 Shield and the Attack rolls 10 or less, Evade triggers; if the Attack rolls 11+, Evade does not.

<a id="faq-damage-resolution"></a>
??? question "What is the damage resolution order?"
    Apply damage in this order: roll Power and apply Power modifiers, apply Immune, apply percent damage modifiers (Fortified/Vulnerable), apply Shield, apply Barrier, apply flat HP modifiers (Resist/Weakness/Absorb), then deal remaining damage to HP.
    Example: An Attack rolls 20. Fortified 1 reduces it to 18. Shield 5 reduces it to 13. Barrier 3 reduces it to 10. Resist 2 reduces it to 8 HP damage.

<a id="faq-hit-vs-damage"></a>
??? question "What's the difference between On Hit, On Damage, and On HP Damage?"
    On Hit triggers when an Attack is a hit, even if it deals 0 damage. On Damage triggers only if damage greater than 0 is dealt to Shield, Barrier, or HP. On HP Damage triggers only if HP is reduced by damage.
    Example: If an Attack is Immune, On Hit triggers but On Damage and On HP Damage do not. If Shield absorbs all damage, On Hit and On Damage trigger but On HP Damage does not.

??? question "How do multiple damage types interact with Resist, Weakness, and Absorb?"
    A card counts as all listed damage types and attack tags. If a modifier lists multiple types or tags, it applies once when any match; separate modifiers stack. For flat/percentage formats, calculate both and use the higher value, then apply after percent modifiers, Shield, and Barrier. If any matching Immune applies, damage becomes 0 before modifiers.
    Example: A Magical + Blunt attack deals 20 damage after Shield and Barrier. The target has Resist 5 (Blunt) and Absorb 30% (Magical). Resist reduces 5, Absorb reduces 6 and heals 6. Final damage is 9.

??? question "How do Created cards enter play?"
    The effect that creates the card tells you where it goes (hand, draw pile, discard pile, or play). If it does not specify, add it to the discard pile.

??? question "Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again?"
    Yes. Reapplying a status effect increases its values according to its mode, up to its cap. For Potency + Count effects, see the next question.

??? question "Is Spend optional?"
    No. "Spend X" is mandatory; if you cannot spend the full amount, that part of the effect does not happen. If a Spend is optional, the effect must say "may."

??? question "If a status effect has potency and count, and an effect says \"Inflict X A\", what happens to the count?"
    If the target already has A, only potency increases by X; count stays the same. If the target has no A, it gains A with potency X and count 1. The same rule applies to Gain on allies.

??? question "What does \"Halve\" mean?"
    "Halve" means set the current value to half of its current value, rounding down (floor). Examples:
    - 5 -> 2
    - 3 -> 1
    - 2 -> 1
    - 1 -> 0

??? question "How do I handle decimals?"
    Any time a calculation results in a decimal, round down (floor). Examples:
    - 2.9 -> 2
    - 1.5 -> 1
    - 0.1 -> 0
