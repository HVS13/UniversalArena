??? question "How do I win a match?"
    Reduce the opposing team's HP to 0 (or meet the scenario's win condition, if you're playing a special mode).

??? question "How does Ultimate Meter work?"
    You gain Ultimate Meter as you play cards; once you have enough, you can pay the Ultimate Meter cost to use your Ultimate card. Ultimate cards sit outside the draw pile and are always available to play.

??? question "Can I bring two of the same character?"
    Not if they have the same Name and Version on the same team.

??? question "Do card or character effects override the core rules?"
    Yes. If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, resolve that effect as written.

??? question "Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again?"
    Yes. Reapplying a status effect increases its potency, count, value, stacks, and so on, up to its cap.

??? question "If a status effect has potency and count, and a skill says \"Inflict X A\", what happens to the count?"
    If the target already has A, only potency increases by X; count stays the same. If the target has no A, it gains A with potency X and count 1.

??? question "What does \"Halve\" mean?"
    "Halve" means set the current value to half of its current value, rounding down (floor). Examples:
    - 5 -> 2
    - 3 -> 1
    - 2 -> 1
    - 1 -> 0

??? question "How do I handle decimals?"
    Any time a calculation results in a decimal, round down (floor). Examples:
    - 2.9 -> 2
    - 1.5 -> 1
    - 0.1 -> 0
