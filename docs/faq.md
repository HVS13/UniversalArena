## Q: How do I win a match?

A: Reduce the opposing team's HP to 0 (or meet the scenario's win condition, if you're playing a special mode).

## Q: How does Ultimate Meter work?

A: You gain Ultimate Meter as you play cards; once you have enough, you can pay the Ultimate Meter cost to use your Ultimate card.

## Q: Can I bring two of the same character?

A: Not if they have the same Name and Version on the same team.

## Q: Do card or character effects override the core rules?

A: Yes. If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, resolve that effect as written.

## Q: Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again?

A: Yes. Reapplying a status effect increases its potency, count, value, stacks, and so on, up to its cap.

## Q: If a status effect has potency and count, and a skill says "Inflict X A", what happens to the count?

A: If the target already has A, only potency increases by X; count stays the same. If the target has no A, it gains A with potency X and count 1.

## Q: What does "Halve" mean?

A: "Halve" means set the current value to half of its current value, rounding down (floor). Examples:
- 5 -> 2
- 3 -> 1
- 2 -> 1
- 1 -> 0

## Q: How do I handle decimals?

A: Any time a calculation results in a decimal, round down (floor). Examples:
- 2.9 -> 2
- 1.5 -> 1
- 0.1 -> 0
