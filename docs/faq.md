??? question "How do I win a match?"
    Reduce all opposing characters' HP to 0 (or meet the scenario's win condition, if you're playing a special mode).

??? question "How does Ultimate Meter work?"
    Your team gains Ultimate Meter as you play cards; it is a shared resource. Once you have enough, any character can pay the Ultimate Meter cost to use its Ultimate card. Ultimate cards sit outside the draw pile and are always available to play.

??? question "Can I bring two of the same character?"
    Not if they have the same Name and Version on the same team.

??? question "Do card or character effects override the core rules?"
    Yes. If a card or character effect contradicts the core rules, apply that effect as written.

??? question "When a card says it becomes another card, is it optional or timing-limited?"
    It is automatic, not optional. Treat the card as the new card in any zone (deck, hand, play) whenever the condition is true.

??? question "What are Basic, Technique, Ultimate, and Created cards?"
    Basic cards are the two core cards in a character's starting five. Technique cards are the three non-basic cards in that starting five. Ultimate cards start outside the draw pile and cost Ultimate Meter. Created cards are generated by effects and follow normal card rules unless the effect says otherwise.

??? question "What is a Combat Round and the Active Zone?"
    A Combat Round starts when the initiative player plays a card. The zone they choose becomes the Active Zone. Players can only add cards to the Active Zone (or a faster zone) until both pass, then the Active Zone resolves right to left.

??? question "Where can I play a card based on Speed?"
    Fast cards can be played in any zone, Normal cards in the Normal or Slow Zone, and Slow cards only in the Slow Zone. A faster zone can interrupt a slower Active Zone.

??? question "How do multiple damage types interact with Resist, Weakness, and Absorb?"
    A card counts as all listed damage types and attack tags. If a modifier lists multiple types or tags, it applies once when any match; separate modifiers stack. For flat/percentage formats, calculate both and use the higher value, then apply after Shield. If any matching Immune applies, damage becomes 0.
    Example: A Magical + Blunt attack deals 20 damage after Shield. The target has Resist 5 (Blunt) and Absorb 30% (Magical). Resist reduces 5, Absorb reduces 6 and heals 6. Final damage is 9.

??? question "How do Created cards enter play?"
    The effect that creates the card tells you where it goes (hand, draw pile, discard pile, or play). If it does not specify, add it to the discard pile.

??? question "Can status effects stack when they are inflicted again?"
    Yes. Reapplying a status effect increases its values according to its mode, up to its cap. For Potency + Count effects, see the next question.

??? question "Is Spend optional?"
    No. "Spend X" is mandatory; if you cannot spend the full amount, that part of the effect does not happen. If a Spend is optional, the effect must say "may."

??? question "If a status effect has potency and count, and an effect says \"Inflict X A\", what happens to the count?"
    If the target already has A, only potency increases by X; count stays the same. If the target has no A, it gains A with potency X and count 1. The same rule applies to Gain on allies.

??? question "What does \"Halve\" mean?"
    "Halve" means set the current value to half of its current value, rounding down (floor). Examples:
    - 5 -> 2
    - 3 -> 1
    - 2 -> 1
    - 1 -> 0

??? question "How do I handle decimals?"
    Any time a calculation results in a decimal, round down (floor). Examples:
    - 2.9 -> 2
    - 1.5 -> 1
    - 0.1 -> 0
