# Combat Round Ref Card

One-page summary of the Combat Round flow, zone rules, and timing ladder. This is a table-ready quick reference, not a replacement for the full rules.

## Flow at a glance

1. Turn Start: draw to hand size, then set Energy.
2. Movement Round: alternate priority to swap adjacent allies (or pass).
3. Combat Round starts when the initiative player plays a card in a legal zone.
4. Players alternate priority to add cards or pass.
5. When both pass, resolve the Active Zone right to left, then continue until all zones are empty.
6. Initiative may start another Combat Round or end the turn.

## Zones by Speed

- Fast: can be played in any zone.
- Normal: can be played in Normal or Slow zones.
- Slow: can only be played in the Slow zone.

## Active Zone rules

- The zone of the first card played is the <a class="ua-term-link" data-term="term-active-zone" href="#">Active Zone</a>.
- After the first play, you may only play in the Active Zone or a faster zone.
- Faster zone interrupt: if a faster zone receives a card, it becomes the Active Zone and the slower zone pauses.
- The Active Zone resolves when priority returns to the last player who played in it and they pass.

## Right-to-left pairing

- Resolve cards in the Active Zone from right to left (last played to first played).
- Take the next card in the resolve order and pair it with the nearest card immediately to its left:
  - No card to the left: use the right card unopposed.
  - Left card is from the other player: the two cards clash.
  - Left card is from the same player: the right card is used unopposed, then discarded; the left card stays.

## Clash outcomes

- Attack vs Attack: higher total Power wins; loser is Cancelled and discarded. Winner stays to be paired again. Ties cancel both.
- Attack vs Defense: Defense is used first (gain Shield), then Attack is used (hit).
- Defense vs Defense: both are used (gain Shield).
- Any vs Special: both are used.

## Timing ladder (card effects)

1. On Play
2. Before Clash
3. After Clash
4. Before Use
5. On Use (default)
6. On Hit
7. After Use
8. Always

## Fast checks

- Only cards in the Active Zone (or a faster zone) may be added.
- Speed changes affect where a card can be played.
- A card is used when its effects apply; a card is played when it is placed in a legal zone.
