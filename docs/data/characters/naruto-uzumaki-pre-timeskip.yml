  Open with Shadow Clone Jutsu to flood your hand with disposable clone attacks
  and bank Shadow Clones as a resource. Keep 1 clone in reserve to turn Defend
  into an Evade. Convert the swarm into Naruto Uzumaki Barrage to win zones via
  Multihit pressure, then cash out with a clone-assisted Rasengan. When
  Nine-Tails' Resentment triggers, Kyuubi Chakra and One-Tail Cloak fuel
  Gamabunta follow-ups and unlock One-Tail Rasengan to close.
